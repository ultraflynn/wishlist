Lens Option 1 - Versatile replacement for the standard kit lens. Would give me great range and useful for most situations.

One of my favourite photographers runs a 1 day workshop on landscape photography. His work is amazing and it would be incredible to spend the day with him learning his approach. The workshop is in Yorkshire though so this would be a bit of a trip. I'd probably take a Friday or a Monday off work to attend this and I'd also be tempted to take the wife along for the ride if she was willing. We could stay in a nice hotel for a couple of nights and eat good food.

## [Joby UltraFit Sling Strap M-XL](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0096JZRBI/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_HqgFzb2SHP68X) - around £30

I'd like a good strap for my camera. The wrist strap I have at the moment is fine but I'd like the option of having both hands free. [product](http://joby.com/ultrafit-sling-strap)

## [Hoya 49 mm Filter Kit II Digital for Lens](http://amzn.eu/4O77i2Y) - around £35

This kits has 3 filters; one for protection from dust, one for bright sunlight and another for long exposures. I'd use these on my current 35mm prime lens (which I use the most) as they wouldn't fit either of the two lenses I've mentioned above.
